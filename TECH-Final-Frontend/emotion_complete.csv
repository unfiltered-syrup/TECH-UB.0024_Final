The worst feeling in the world is when you cant love anyone else because your heart still belongs to the one who broke it.,Heartbreak
Pleasure of love lasts but a moment. Pain of love lasts a lifetime,Heartbreak
Only time can heal your broken heart. Just as only time can heal his broken arms and legs,Heartbreak
Crying is a way your eyes speak when your mouth cant explain how broken your heart is.,Heartbreak
I think about you. But I dont say it anymore.,Heartbreak
One day youre going to remember me and how much I loved you then youre going to hate yourself for letting me go,Heartbreak
"I gave you my heart, I just didnt expect to get it back in pieces",Heartbreak
The scariest thing is that we didnt even have to be together for you to break my heart,Heartbreak
"I think you are wrong to want a heart. It makes most people unhappy. If you only knew it, you are in luck not to have a heart.",Heartbreak
"You cant buy love, but you can pay heavily for it.",Heartbreak
You dont die from a broken heart. You only wish you did,Heartbreak
"You will never know true happiness until you have truly loved, and you will never understand what pain really is until you have lost it",Heartbreak
"I wont ever leave you, even though youre always leaving me",Heartbreak
You werent just a star to me. You were my whole damn sky,Heartbreak
"Where you used to be, there is a hole in the world, which I find myself constantly walking around in the daytime, and falling in at night. I miss you like hell.",Heartbreak
"You left with my soul in your fists and my heart in your teeth, and I dont want either of them back",Heartbreak
I dont know why they call it heartbreak. It feels like every other part of my body is broken too,Heartbreak
"Love is the hardest drug to quit, but it is even harder when it is taken away",Heartbreak
